            <h1>Insights and Discussion</h1>
            <p>After exploration of the visualisation, some useful insights can be gained accordingly. With sliding between the years, it is shown that the number of exoneration cases increase during the last ten years, the reason behind is yet clear while a reasonable guess could be more advanced technology to detect biological evidence. In terms of race, Black people make up the most section. By selecting the options, female tend to be less exonerated, nevertheless they consist of a tiny part. The most crimes in exoneration case was murder followed by sexual assault which may result from new DNA evidence.  The years of lost can be seen from the length of the lines, and some of them are over 60 years long which is a huge tragedy for those people. This could lead to quire an amount of research topics in different fields, such us psychological study of why people plead guilty when they did not commit the crime, or how to help those who suffered prison life for a long time to recover.

                The limitation of the work relates to the dataset as well as the design itself. For example, the years of lost is rough, for it only calculates the year. The slider among the years may distract people a bit with all the animation, and different scale of x-axis and y_axis makes it hard to compare, an overlap line graph showing the total trend could be helpful. Another way to compare is to apply a sort function and align all the lines to the y-axis.  Also, a map could be implemented to show the link between exonerations and the region.
