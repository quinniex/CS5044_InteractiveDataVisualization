            <h1>Data and Questions</h1>
            <p>This dataset provides a detailed review of all the exoneration cases in the USA since 1989. Exoneration is a term meaning a person who was once been convicted of a crime is officially cleared based on new evidence of innocence <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.aspx">[1]</a>. The dataset is currently updated and has included 2204 data points so far. For this assignment, in order to present a more focused visualization as well as reduce the loads, the original dataset has been modified as 10 separate small spreadsheets (each contains less than 150 cases) to indicate cases during the last ten years. Key attributes chosen are age, race, sex, State, convicted year, exonerated year, sentence and crime. Besides, convicted year and exonerated year have been converted into two ages (Age1, Age2) which calculates years of lost. Each data point represents an individual and a unique id is generated instead of using real names. Among these attributes, Age1, Age2, Sentence and Years of Lost are numerical while Sex, Race, State and Crime are nominal. The id of each data point is considered as ordinal to present the number of cases.

                Exoneration has always been a sensitive topic and triggered discussion among the society. While some exoneration cases remain disputable until now, there were new exonerees ever once in while who finally got cleared and got home due to new evidence of innocence. Even though the reasons behind them are complicated, this visualization work aims to dig out the link between possibility of exoneration and other related attributes. The intended question to answer is "how many years of prison life people suffered before exoneration?" and "What is the relationship between exoneration and other factors such as race and crime? (Which group of people suffered most? Which crime is easier to wrongly convicted?)". The visualization is open to general public and those who are interested in the topic, especially people who works in the field of law, psychology or biology who are all important contributors to a future of less misjudged cases.
